# Wikiquotes Scraper

Improved for use in generating training sets for language models from
wikiquotes.

Originating from:
[blog of Lucas Z ](https://www.lukaszielinski.de/blog/posts/2019/01/20/how-to-scrape-wikiquote/#:~:text=Open%20it%20on%20your%20browser,lines%20that%20only%20contain%20quotes.)
who explained that you could go the edit page of wikiquotes, and scrap the text
from there. He did it using ruby and published his repo
[here](https://github.com/lukas2/wikiquote_to_fortune).

## Requirements

1. resources
2. beautiful-soup4

`pip install resources beautifulsoup4`

## Installation

Pretty straightforward.
